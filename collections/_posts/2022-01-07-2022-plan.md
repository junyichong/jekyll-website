<br/>

### Individual Stocks (50%)

Sell stocks that I don't have strong enough conviction.
Continue finding great businesses that I understand.
Do valuation and wait.
Buy in batches when the price falls in my fair value range.


Some great companies that are not too far off from my valuation:

Alphabet ($GOOG), Meta Platforms ($FB), Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM), Disney ($DIS), Xiaomi (HKG:1810)

<br/>

### ETF    (25%)


##### $CSPX

A much smaller S&P500 index-tracking ETF compared to $SPY and $VOO. However, it is more attractive to foreigners with lower dividend withholding tax, and is easier to manage because the dividend is automatically reinvested. I would love to have it as a benchmark to see if I can do better with picking individual stocks after learning for more than a year in the market.

Buy every quarter.
Don't try to time the market.


##### $SMH

One of the best-performing holdings I had in 2021 because of the boom of the semiconductor industry. I am still bullish in the sector but some of the companies are just way too overvalued. A good way to hold great monopolies like $TSM, $ASML, $NVDA and more.


##### $IPAY

Another industry that I am optimistic about - mobile/cashless payment. Bought some during the selloff in 2021. $V, $MA, $PYPL, $SQ are all companies I am interested in but there is just too much competition to be sure which company will come on top. The improvement of the technology of cryptocurrencies especially lightning network might disrupt the whole industry too.


##### $KWEB

China internet sector ETF which had dropped more than 50% from its peak. Wouldn't mind buying more due to the cheap valuation but beware not to overexpose to Chinese stocks. I plan to keep the Chinese part of my portfolio under 30%.


##### $META

I might buy this for exposure to metaverse concept companies like $NVDA, $U, $RBLX. However, these companies have just too crazy valuations to justify buying. 

<br/>

### Cryptocurrencies  (15%)


##### BTC, ETH
Buy more if the market crashes.
HODL if the bull market continues.
Keep my exposure to below 15%.


##### WhiteBoardCrypto Club

Learn more about DeFi and blockchain.
Don't waste the $29 per month.
Be cautious with NFT.

<br/>

### Cash    (10%)
Have at least 10% cash in my brokerage accounts at all times.
Put in more money after I settle everything in university.
