				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3><p>My Investment Portfolio</p>
</h3>
    		<p>5 min.</p>
				<div><h1 id="ahhh-its-rewind-time">AHHH IT’S REWIND TIME</h1>

<p><br /></p>

<p>2021 is definitely a bad year. I lost 19.6% of my portfolio this year, with only cryptocurrencies in the green. If I had invested all my money in the S&amp;P500 in January, I would have made 26.9% this year, which means I would have 50% more money than I have now.</p>

<p>I went through all my winners and losers, and write down all the lessons and mistakes I have learnt, hopefully 17% is the biggest loss I will ever have. One thing I am most grateful for is that I made all these blunders when I am 22, instead of 44 when I should have a much higher net worth and a lower risk tolerance.</p>

<p>Since I didn’t do a recap for 2020, below are all the things the market taught me from September 2020 till the end of 2021.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="open-positions">Open Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="ethereum-59-6-of-portfolio">Ethereum <em>(+59%, 6% of portfolio)</em></h5>

<p>I had my biggest gain of 2021 in a cryptocurrency, who would have thought. I wouldn’t be surprised if the NFT bubble pops and crashes ETH.
Crypto is still a non-productive asset.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="apple-48-15-of-portfolio">Apple <em>(+48%, 1.5% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>My biggest winner in 2021 - a single share of $AAPL.</p>

<p>The strong get stronger.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="public-bank-36-4-of-portfolio">Public Bank <em>(+36%, 4% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>The first stock I ever bought. Should’ve taken the advantage of the spike after the bonus issue where the price was at RM4.70 for no reason. I knew the stock was overpriced but didn’t sell because I wanted to hold on to my first stock.</p>

<p>Bonus issue or stock split doesn’t make a difference in the value of the business.
Don’t be overly attached to a stock.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="bitcoin-21-8-of-portfolio">Bitcoin <em>(+21%, 8% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>Don’t try to time the market.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="tenaga-nasional-05-12-of-portfolio">Tenaga Nasional <em>(+0.5%, 12% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>I bought the stock because of the monopoly by Tenaga. Got a few rounds of dividends but they couldn’t make up the drop in share price. At one point I was over-exposed to the stock but now sold off 25%.</p>

<p>Don’t buy a company that is not growing.
Check for special dividend and dividend payout ratio.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="alibaba--30-15-of-portfolio">Alibaba <em>(-30%, 15% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>I bought all the way down from $240 to $125. I still have a pretty high conviction, let’s see how it plays out! I see this as my first true test as a value investor.</p>

<p>Don’t clone blindly.
Identify what changes the fundamental and what is just noise.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="clover-health--61-6-of-portfolio">Clover Health <em>(-61%, 6% of portfolio)</em></h5>
<p>A stock that r/wallstreetbets was speculating for a short squeeze, or a gamma squeeze, whatever it is. It crashed when the management announced a new share offering at a really low price without an explanation, which is a huge red flag. I still believe the company has a good growth prospect but I certainly bought in too early.</p>

<p>NO MORE FOMO!
Buy only profitable companies.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="closed-positions">Closed Positions</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="revenue-40">Revenue <em>(+40%)</em></h5>
<p>I bought when the stock had a P/E ratio of 70, which is in hindsight too high considering the growth shown by the company. At one point I was up almost 100% but it didn’t make an impact because I bought too little. The CEO said a lot about making an ecosystem, digital banking, overseas expansion, etc but no real progress so far (might be because of Covid-19). I sold the stock because I was holding too little of it, might be buying back if it drops to its fair value.</p>

<p>Beware of management that gives too many promises.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="arbb-4">ARBB <em>(+4%)</em></h5>
<p>The company is in a growing industry with a P/E ratio of only 3. Sold after the Serba Dinamik saga as the company has the exact same problem - high receivables.</p>

<p>Sometimes a company has a low valuation for a reason.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="hong-seng--2">Hong Seng <em>(-2%)</em></h5>
<p>After seeing the news about the company’s plan to manufacture gloves, I bought the stock in anticipation of the stock going up like other glove stocks, without doing any further research. I sold off when the price didn’t go anywhere after a few months. However, the stock had 7x at its peak in 2021.</p>

<p>You can’t hold a stock without strong conviction.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="teledoc--2">Teledoc <em>(-2%)</em></h5>
<p>Followed Cathie Wood who kept buying the dip, without doing proper valuation. The price dropped another 35% after I sold.</p>

<p>Buy after a company had proved their business model.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="bursa-malaysia--12">Bursa Malaysia <em>(-12%)</em></h5>
<p>I bought it because I expected the daily trading value to be around 3B which is higher than pre-pandemic. Sold when the market cooled off quickly (ADV of ~2B) after the announcement of increased trading cost.</p>

<p>Always have a margin of safety.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="cypark--24">Cypark <em>(-24%)</em></h5>
<p>High debt company. Sold after it announced private placement.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="vivocom--45">Vivocom <em>(-45%)</em></h5>
<p>My first huge loss in the stock market. Blindly trusting the confidence of a Facebook page Mr Bursa, and hoping to get some quick profit, I bought right at the top and kept buying the ‘dip’. I didn’t even know what the company does. The stock has down another 60% after I sold.</p>

<p>There is no easy money.
If something is too good to be true, it’s not.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="kpower--51">Kpower <em>(-51%)</em></h5>
<p>The company seemed to be transitioning into great industries, namely renewable energy and logistic. However, it crashed along with Serba Dinamik as they share the same director. I bought the dip after making the judgement that it has independent management and no real connection with Serba Dinamik, which turned out to be a bad decision. It has dropped another 40% after I sold my last positions.</p>

<p>Never buy a company just because of a high profile CEO</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="serba-dinamik--52">Serba Dinamik <em>(-52%)</em></h5>
<p>This is definitely my biggest lesson in 2021. Even though I was a self-proclaimed value investor since the beginning, the unfortunate case of Serba Dinamik was what got me into digging into a company’s financials and doing serious valuation.</p>

<p>When I was getting started in the stock market, I thought I found a gem that was trading at a low P/E ratio with high growth. However, the EPS actually didn’t increase much as they kept issuing new shares over the years through private placement. I felt strange when the company kept venturing into new businesses (e-commerce, IT, space exploration) but failed to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Sold after the company got exposed for accounting fraud, where it’s suspected that some of the receivables were made up, and the stock price suffered limit down (30% decline) for 2 days straight. Glad I made the right call by selling at a huge loss, the stock is now suspended from trading.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beware of dilution.</li>
  <li>No company should raise funds to give dividends.</li>
  <li>Avoid companies with high receivables.</li>
  <li>Free cash flow is the money made, not net earnings. In a good company, the two should align.</li>
  <li>Diworsification is a real thing.</li>
  <li>Sell company that involves in an accounting scandal immediately. You can always buy back when the issue is resolved.</li>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3><p>My Investment Plan</p>
</h3>
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p><img src="../assets/image/blog/2022bad.jpg" alt="2021 is finally over!" title="2022 is coming!" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="individual-stocks-50">Individual Stocks (50%)</h3>

<p>Sell stocks that I don’t have strong enough conviction.
Continue finding great businesses that I understand.
Do valuation and wait.
Buy in batches when the price falls in my fair value range.</p>

<p>Some great companies that are not too far off from my valuation:</p>

<p>Alphabet ($GOOG), Meta Platforms ($FB), Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM), Disney ($DIS), Xiaomi (HKG:1810)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="etf----25">ETF    (25%)</h3>

<h5 id="cspx">$CSPX</h5>

<p>A much smaller S&amp;P500 index-tracking ETF compared to $SPY and $VOO. However, it is more attractive to foreigners with lower dividend withholding tax, and is easier to manage because the dividend is automatically reinvested. I would love to have it as a benchmark to see if I can do better with picking individual stocks after learning for more than a year in the market.</p>

<p>Buy every quarter.
Don’t try to time the market.</p>

<h5 id="smh">$SMH</h5>

<p>One of the best-performing holdings I had in 2021 because of the boom of the semiconductor industry. I am still bullish in the sector but some of the companies are just way too overvalued. A good way to hold great monopolies like $TSM, $ASML, $NVDA and more.</p>

<h5 id="ipay">$IPAY</h5>

<p>Another industry that I am optimistic about - mobile/cashless payment. Bought some during the selloff in 2021. $V, $MA, $PYPL, $SQ are all companies I am interested in but there is just too much competition to be sure which company will come on top. The improvement of the technology of cryptocurrencies especially lightning network might disrupt the whole industry too.</p>

<h5 id="kweb">$KWEB</h5>

<p>China internet sector ETF which had dropped more than 50% from its peak. Wouldn’t mind buying more due to the cheap valuation but beware not to overexpose to Chinese stocks. I plan to keep the Chinese part of my portfolio under 30%.</p>

<h5 id="meta">$META</h5>

<p>I might buy this for exposure to metaverse concept companies like $NVDA, $U, $RBLX. However, these companies have just too crazy valuations to justify buying.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="cryptocurrencies--15">Cryptocurrencies  (15%)</h3>

<h6 id="btc-eth">BTC, ETH</h6>
<p>Buy more if the market crashes.
HODL if the bull market continues.
Keep my exposure to below 15%.</p>

<h5 id="whiteboardcrypto-club">WhiteBoardCrypto Club</h5>

<p>Learn more about DeFi and blockchain.
Don’t waste the $29 per month.
Be cautious with NFT.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="cash----10">Cash    (10%)</h3>
<p>Have at least 10% cash in my brokerage accounts at all times.
Put in more money after I settle everything in university.</p>

			<title>Serba Dinamik: The Hindsight</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>4 min.</p>
				<div><p>Earlier this year, Serba Dinamik’s auditor KPMG had raised issues regarding the company’s sales transactions, trade receivables and payables, as well as material on-site balances. The issues raised involved 11 parties which accounted for total sales transactions of RM2.32 billion, trade receivables balance of RM652 million and materials on site balance of RM569 million. Since then, the share price of the company had dropped all the way down from RM1.6 to RM0.35 and has been suspended from trading since October 22.</p>

<p>However, that didn’t free Serba Dinamik from further troubles such as preventing the release of a special independent review (SIR), failing to release their annual report, endless changes in the board room, and missing coupon payments, just to name a few. Currently, they are seeking legal recourse against Bursa Malaysia, EY and its original auditors KPMG.</p>

<p>Even though I’m definitely sceptical about Serba Dinamik’s innocence, I’m not here to judge who’s right and wrong, since the damage to all the retail investors’ wealth had already been done (including 52% of my invested capital). Instead, I’m trying to learn from my mistake of investing in Serba Dinamik by studying their annual reports from 2013 to 2021.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="the-big-6">The Big 6</h3>
<p>Let’s start by analyzing the 6 most important things to identify a great business, credit to Rule #1 by Phil Town. (It’s originally The Big 5, but I modified it a bit.)</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="The Big 6" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/big6.png" alt="The Big 6" />
</div>

<p>At first sight, this seems like a rare gem that almost checks all the boxes. Some of the companies that I found so many greens are monopolies like $GOOG, $FB and $MSFT. However, a closer look will prove otherwise. For one, the seemingly high free cash flow growth is actually growing over 50% in the negative direction. In hindsight, below are all the issues that I could’ve found in their financial statements, without looking into their allegedly questionable business practices, but just the numbers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="dilution">Dilution</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Dilution" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph1.png" alt="Dilution" />
</div>

<p>5-year net income CAGR:    25.6%</p>

<p>5-year earnings per share CAGR:    16.5%</p>

<p>Even though the company had a really impressive net income 5-year CAGR of over 30%, its EPS growth rates were almost always lower than its net income growth rate, and in some years was just half of that of its earnings. Don’t get me wrong, 16% CAGR is in no way weak growth, but this should be the first red flag that the company is diluting its shareholders since the earnings had to be divided into more and more shares.</p>

<p>From the income statements, they actually grew the shares outstanding from 2.7 billion in 2017 to 3.7 billion in 2021, with a CAGR of 7.8%. This is actually not that bad, considering high-growth companies usually need more cash to fund their operations. For comparison, $TSLA diluted their shareholders by 10.7% annually from 2017 to 2020.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="receivables">Receivables</h3>

<p>Receivables are debts owed to a company by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for. Receivables are recorded as revenue at the time of a sale when a good or service has been delivered but not yet been paid for.</p>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Receivables" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph2.png" alt="Receivables" />
</div>

<p>In the case of Serba Dinamik, their receivables were growing strongly along with their revenue and earnings, and in recent years, the receivables generated in a single year were even higher than the net income of the year. If they failed to collect the payments from their customers, it would risk wiping out all the net income.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="free-cash-flow">Free Cash Flow</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Free Cash Flow" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph3.png" alt="Free Cash Flow" />
</div>

<p>Free cash flow is the real profit generated for the owners, while net income is just the money made on the income statement. Therefore, it is said that buying a company is buying the future cash flow of the company. In a good company, free cash flow and net income generated should be heading in the same direction in the long run, even though there might be some one-time events that hurt the free cash flow. For Serba Dinamik, the two were both growing consistently, in a completely different directions. By running a company like this, you can achieve good growth on the earnings reports but will never see the money coming into your pocket (unless you are a genius and do the following trick).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="fund-raising">Fund Raising</h3>

<div class="w3-container" style="padding:0px 0px 10px">
    <img title="Fund Raising" class="w3-image w3-padding" width="400" src="../assets/image/blog/serbadk/graph4.png" alt="Fund Raising" />
</div>

<p>From 2017 to 2021, the company raised around RM2.2 billion from its investors by issuing new shares. However, the company had also been increasing the dividends paid to their shareholders, at a stunning rate of 35%. For a company that failed to generate free cash flow every year, they sure were generous with their dividends. This essentially means that they were getting cash from their investors, just to give a part out as dividends. In the end, the management was the people who benefited from the multiple fund-raisings by pocketing their huge sum of dividends.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>金玉其外，败絮其中 is a Chinese idiom which means something that is looking good on the outside but is a mess on the inside.</p>

<p>The top-line and bottom-line growth alone can’t give the full picture of how well a company is doing, but what is on the headline is always revenue and income. Always look for red flags in a company’s financial statements. Don’t be a sheep.</p>

			<title>Being Multilingual</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>5 min.</p>
				<div><p>This comes from the perspective of a person (me) who can technically (it’s complicated, trust me) speak 5 languages. Here’s a little about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My mother tongue is Chinese.</li>
  <li>I have had 13 years of formal education in Chinese, English and Malay.</li>
  <li>I learnt to speak Cantonese through Hong Kong movies and dramas.</li>
  <li>My family speaks Hakka, which I can understand but can’t speak.</li>
  <li>I’m currently studying mechanical engineering in Japanese.</li>
  <li>I just started learning German in Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some of the advantages, struggles and thoughts I found about being multilingual. I’m not sure about all those “increased career opportunities” claims though, but I wish I could get a five-fold salary.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="learning-a-new-language-is-easy">Learning a new language is easy</h3>

<p>Let’s start off with a common one! Coming from someone who knows Chinese, arguably one of the hardest languages to learn, I find learning Japanese really not that hard.</p>

<p>Having 10+ years of experience writing Chinese characters undoubtedly gave me a huge head start in learning Japanese, so I really can’t brag about how easy Japanese is. However, being able to speak Cantonese just by watching TV might be a prove of this point.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3 id="open-for-more-information">Open for more information</h3>

<p>Multilingual means I can do multilingual searches on Google.</p>

<p>When you are doing research or studying, knowing more languages won’t hurt. You can find way more tutorials and papers online in English than say, Japanese. When I have a hard time understanding a topic in Japanese, I always try googling it in Chinese and English, which most of the time gives me a better understanding. Okay, maybe because my Japanese sucks.</p>

<p>Knowing less language really limits the information you can obtain from the world, the internet especially.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="getting-a-bigger-picture">Getting a bigger picture</h3>

<p>We all have been click-baited by a news site before. Even if it’s about the same topic, journalists of different news sources will try to come up with titles and articles that are more likely to be clicked on and shared by their targeted readers.</p>

<p>In Malaysia, people of different races generally have very different cultures, religions, political views, and often, they speak different languages and consume only media of their own language. Because of that, so-called “news sites” will always filter or tweak the news to fit with what their readers want to see, religiously or politically, to a point where the bias is obvious.</p>

<p>It’s certainly wiser to get your daily news from different sources, even better if you read them in different languages, to get a bigger picture of what really happened.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="making-friends-through-translation">Making friends through translation</h3>

<p>You can make friends pretty naturally by being the translation guy, more effective than any conversation starter because they’ll have no choice but to talk to you. (not joking)</p>

<p>There are activities in my school which students from different countries will be joining. Korean who speaks Korean and Japanese, Taiwanese who speaks Chinese and a bit of English, Singaporean who speaks English, as well as Japanese who speaks only Japanese, but there was me, who can understand and connect them all!</p>

<p>Not just through translation, knowing extra languages can help make more friends from all over the world!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="always-having-a-backup-language">Always having a backup language</h3>

<p>We all have moments where we need to talk to our friend without a third person understanding, mainly out of politeness (because what we’re about to say might not be polite enough, like talking shit). With a few languages in my pocket, I’m able to pull out the right language at the right time.</p>

<p>I can ask my Chinese friend, “几点要回？走咯走咯。” in a never-ending Hari Raya open house.
I can tell my Malay friend, “Tak nak lah, mahal ni,” in an overpriced Japanese outlet.
I can tell my spy friend, “- -    - — - -    — - —” over a bugged phone call.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="speaking-in-only-one-language-is-hard">Speaking in only one language is hard</h3>

<p>I’m well aware of how messed up my languages are. My Chinese is mixed with Cantonese and English, and I can’t speak English without some sort of Chinese slang.</p>

<p>I’ve always had to flick the “Use only one language” switch on when I’m talking to people that only speak one language, like Taiwanese, American and Japanese. I’ll always have to think twice in my head whether they can understand a certain phrase I use, and try to find a “real” word as a replacement. That’s a struggle for me being multilingual but of course a very good training indeed.</p>

<p>I love my Singaporean friends who have similar backgrounds, which means we can speak Chinglish/Manglish/Singlish together, hooray!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="keyboard-sucks">Keyboard sucks</h3>

<p>As a person who has to text in multiple languages, I have to tap the little globe icon on my phone keyboard to switch between inputs, namely English, Chinese, Japanese, and a handwriting keyboard whenever I can’t read a kanji.</p>

<p>It’s especially annoying when I accidentally missed the language I want to use next and had to tap another three times to switch it back, only to realize that I tapped too fast and missed it again. And repeat.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="multilingual-faqs"><strong>Multilingual FAQs</strong></h2>

<h3 id="1-you-can-speak-so-many-languages-are-you-a-genius">1. You can speak so many languages, are you a genius?</h3>

<p>Seriously, I did not make this question up. I get this sometimes from my Japanese classmates, who are surprised to learn that I know so many languages.</p>

<p>No, I’m really not a genius. I know dozens of people personally who are like me. If you were born in Malaysia, being bilingual or multilingual is really common, I’m just lucky to have the chance to learn additional Japanese.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-language-do-you-think-in">2. What language do you think in?</h3>

<p>I’d say that I can think in the language I’m speaking most of the time, without needing to do translation in my head. If I’m just thinking random stuff without talking out loud, it’s primarily in Chinese, but with sprinkles of English words like how I normally speak. However, I realized that I process math in English no matter the language I’m learning math with.</p>

<h3 id="3-which-language-is-the-easiesthardest">3. Which language is the easiest/hardest?</h3>

<p>To be honest, I really have no idea. Mainly because it’s been so long since I started learning most of the languages I know. It’s said that children can learn a language much easier than an average adult, so I guess all of them were pretty easy for 5-year-old me to learn.</p>

<p>If I have to pick one as the hardest, I’d probably say Japanese because that’s the only language I still remember the learning process. Anyway, I remember I struggled a lot in English spelling in kindergarten. Poem and classical Chinese in high school were difficult too.</p>

<h3 id="4-can-you-say-something-in-language">4. CaN yOu SaY sOmEtHiNg In (language)?</h3>

<p>Yes, thank you for requesting. No, I only do paid performance. How about saying something in Python? I know a saying that goes</p>

<p>print(“stfu”)</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

			<title>Should I Get a Part-time Job in Japan?</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				
    		<p>4 min.</p>
				<div><p>One of the most surprising things I encountered in Japan is the percentage of students having a part-time job. Among my 46 classmates, I can confidently say that at least 30 of them are working after school, mostly at a restaurant or a convenience store. The number might even be higher because I don’t really know every one of them.</p>

<p>Some of the seniors from Malaysia in my area work as a tutor at a tuition centre, teaching middle school students science and maths. Working as a cashier or a waiter in Japan usually earn 900 yen per hour, while a tutor can earn much more.</p>

<p>Back in my high school life (in Malaysia), there was pretty much no one in my class that worked part-time after school. There were just too many tuition classes to attend and too many expectations to not disappoint. The low pay might also be one of the reasons I think.</p>

<p>I’m always curious about the reasons for working while studying. In fact, some of my classmates couldn’t balance earning and studying, forcing them to retake several papers, or in a worse case, putting themselves on the verge of repeating the same class for another year. In my opinion, student studies, and education should always be the priority.</p>

<p>Of course, there are people who have to pay for their own bills, or have to work to support their family, even if they are still an 18-year-old student. Everyone has their own circumstances. Not everyone is lucky like me.</p>

<p>However, from what I see, most of them just wanted to save money to buy things they like, most of the time really expensive things. High-end game consoles, phones, clothes, shoes, fishing reels (yes, the guy on my right spent ¥20,000 on one), you name it. Buying things you like with your hard-earned money is not necessarily a bad thing, but I don’t see the necessity.</p>

<p>One of my friends spent ¥52465 for a pair of Eytys Halo Suede Off White, size 41. Woah, how did I know all the details? He couldn’t read the English website so I translated every word for him (except for the T&amp;C). He worked almost 60 hours for the shoes, which is really beyond my imagination. An 18-year-old me wouldn’t even spend more than RM40 for a t-shirt and it still hurts if I do it now.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-get-from-working-part-time">What can I get from working part-time?</h2>

<p>As a scholar who is being paid to study and has allowance enough to travel multiple times a year, do I really need to work? That’s the question I asked myself a lot last year.</p>

<p>Like any other job, it comes down to just two things: Money and experience.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-the-money">Do I need the money?</h3>

<p>Who doesn’t like having more money, right? If you think about it, working part-time in Japan can even make more money than a newly graduated engineer in Malaysia. A foreign student in Japan can work up to 28 hours a week, which can earn around ¥100,000 (~RM4,000) every month, more than the salary of a fresh graduate in Malaysia (RM3,000-RM4,000).</p>

<p>I’m really privileged to not have any problems financially, all thanks to the sponsor of this post, JPA. That means every cent I ever made from a part-time job will go straight into my saving.</p>

<p>If I could save more in Japan, my life would be so much easier when I’m back in Malaysia. I could’ve started saving money to buy a house or start a business now, earlier than all of my peers.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-the-experience">Do I need the experience?</h3>

<p>Through doing a part-time job, I can get more chances to communicate with Japanese in a polite and (overly) formal way. It must be worth my time and energy if I get to work in Japan after getting my degree.</p>

<p>But that’s not the case for me. I have to work for the Malaysian government in order to not be in debt right after graduating.</p>

<p>If I were to work part-time, I would surely choose a job that could be useful for my endeavour to become an engineer. At least I don’t see how working as a cashier help.</p>

<p>Of course working as a tutor is a great experience, no matter what my job will be in the future. I am teaching English in my school once or twice in a month too! Even though I suck at teaching!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="so-should-i-get-a-part-time-job">So, should I get a part-time job?</h2>

<p>Maybe I should, but I won’t, at least for now. It’s no doubt that I have the free time to work and I don’t mind having extra cash in my pocket. But I feel like I have better things to do.</p>

<p>I’m still searching for what I really like, and what kind of profession suits me best. Since last year, I’ve been taking courses online, learning about machine learning, web development, CAD modelling and more to come. There I discovered and developed a great interest and passion in coding, and I would love to dive deeper in the world of colourful texts. And yes, I started writing too!</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be able to do all these if I started working part-time.</p>

<p>Is learning new stuff on the internet worth more than ¥1000 per hour? I don’t know, but I guess I will continue doing what I like for now, when I still have the time to do so.</p>

<p>That’s my two cents on getting a part-time job as a student. My view might change later and I will update this post when it does.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

			<title>Flake it till you make it</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3><p>Excerpt from Soulshaping by Jeff Brown</p>
</h3>
    		<p>2 min.</p>
				<div><p>Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?</p>

<p>The truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.</p>

<p>At the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.</p>

<p>A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.</p>

			<title>To be</title>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[	
 				<h3><p>… or not to be?</p>
</h3>
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p>To be, or not to be–that is the question:
Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep–
No more–and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. ‘Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep–
To sleep–perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There’s the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely
The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprise of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action. – Soft you now,
The fair Ophelia! – Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remembered.</p>

 				<h3><p>Best sport ever!</p>
</h3>
    		<p>1 min.</p>
				<div><p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world’s most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.</p>

<p>The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.[7]</p>

<p>Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world’s most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.</p>

<p>The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.[7]</p>

				<div><p>Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.</p>
